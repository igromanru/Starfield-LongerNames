First of all, make sure you don't use an older or a different version of the mod. Especially if you've installed my fixed version from GitHub before, you should delete the [b]Starfield-LongerNames.dll[/b] or uninstall it with the mod manager!  

If you're 100% sure that you're using the right SFSE for your game version and you still have trouble with the mod, please provide following information, if you want to report an issue.  
[list=1]
[*]Your game version and update version (Steam/GamePass/Cracked, version 1.7.36 etc.)
[*]Which mod version are you using, SFSE or ASI
[*]Provide content of log files. For SFSE all logs should be in the Documents directory ([i]C:\Users\(windows user name)\Documents\My Games\Starfield\SFSE\Logs\[/i]), there I need the content of [b]sfse.txt[/b], [b]sfse_loader.txt[/b] and [b]SF-LongerNames.log[/b] files.
For the ASI version, if you're on Steam, the log file [b]SF-LongerNames.log[/b] should be in the [i](game root)/Plugins/[/i] directory. If you have the GamePass version, I don't think a log will be written. But overall with ASI Loader you will get error messages pop ups, if something went wrong.
