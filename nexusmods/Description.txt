[size=4][u][b]Description[/b][/u][/size]
Fixed and improved version of the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1635]Longer Ship Outpost and Item Names[/url], which is currently abandoned. The mod increases the maximum name length allowed for Outposts and Ships. it actually never worked for Items, because items have a second check that resets items name, if the name length exceeds 26 characters.  
I made the mod update resistant, it supports all versions since release and I even made an ASI Loader version, for people who are playing the GamePass version of the game. The original author even merged my changes into his repository, but then vanished. I'll maintain the mod for now.

[size=4][u][b]Uninstall[/b][/u][/size]
To uninstall the mod/plugin manually, delete the [b]SF-LongerNames.dll[/b] from your [i](game root)\Data\SFSE\plugins\[/i] directory.

[size=4][u][b]Configuration[/b][/u][/size]
You can change the maximum allowed names length in the [b]SF-LongerNames.ini[/b].
1. You will find the [b]SF-LongerNames.ini[/b] in the installation directory of the mod. It should be in [i](game root)[/i][i]\Data\SFSE\plugins\[/i] directory for the SFSE version.
    [size=2]If the file doesn't exist, start the game once, until the main menu, then the file should appear But close the game again, before doing any changes.[/size]
2. Open the SF-LongerNames.ini with any Text Editor and change the value of [b]ShipNameMaxChars[/b].
The value must be between 5 and 255.
3. Save the file and start the game again.

[size=4][u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u][/size]
Obviously the mod is not compatible with [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/1635]Longer Ship Outpost and Item Names[/url]. Which is currently outdated anyway, but if you're playing on the older version of the game or it will be fixed in the future, you shouldn't try to use both mods at the same time.
